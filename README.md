A car rental enterprise maintains a comprehensive record of its rental operations within a compact database structure, organized as tables. This company, in operation since 2021, has successfully facilitated the rental of over 1,000 vehicles to a customer base exceeding 3,000 individuals. The company has approached me with the task of transferring their complete rental history into a Data Warehouse to facilitate streamlined analytical processes.

To embark upon this endeavor, I am expected to meticulously assess the provided sample dataset, extracting pertinent facts and dimensions inherent to the business's operations. This will involve formulating SQL commands that establish the foundational structure of the derived tables as per the identified insights. Furthermore, I am tasked with composing an Entity-Relationship Diagram (ERD) that methodically illustrates the relationships and dependencies within the constructed data model.

In the pursuit of maintaining systematic and organized development, as a Data Engineer I am encouraged to employ Version Control practices to safeguard against potential inconsistencies and ensure traceability throughout the project's lifecycle. The furnished sample dataset will serve as a basis for the execution of these tasks, fostering an efficacious and insightful transition of data into the designated Data Warehouse environment.
